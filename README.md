🛡️ CertiGuard

“Securing Trust, One Certificate at a Time.”

CertiGuard is an intelligent certificate management and authentication platform built using Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It offers a seamless way to issue, verify, and manage digital certificates securely — powered by AI-driven analysis and a modern, scalable architecture.

🚀 Features

🔐 AI-Enhanced Verification – Automatically validate certificate authenticity using embedded data and pattern recognition.

🧠 Smart Certificate Detection – The integrated AI module (src/ai/) identifies document types and extracts metadata.

⚡ Real-Time Validation – Built with serverless support (apphosting.yaml) for instant access and zero downtime.

🎨 Modern UI – Styled with TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive, and minimal experience.

🧩 Modular Architecture – Uses context and hooks for state management, making it easy to extend and maintain.

🧾 Secure & Scalable – TypeScript ensures safety and predictability throughout the codebase.

🧠 How It Works

Upload / Generate Certificates – Admins or authorized users can issue certificates digitally.

Verification – Each certificate includes an encrypted identifier verified by CertiGuard’s backend logic.

AI Validation – The AI module cross-checks metadata and document structure for signs of tampering.

Instant Result – The verification outcome (Valid / Invalid / Suspicious) is displayed with confidence scores.

🪄 Future Enhancements

Blockchain-based certificate logging

QR-code integration for physical verification

Role-based access control (Admin / Issuer / Viewer)

Email and SMS notification integration
